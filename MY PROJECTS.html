    <h3>Digital Tachometer using 8051 Microcontroller using IR sensor</h3>
    <p> The Contactless Digital Tachometer involves a simple embedded system with a sensor, a controller and an actuator. The sensor used here is Infrared (IR) transmitter â€“ receiver pair, the controller used is the 8051 Microcontroller loaded with a compiled code and the actuator is a display device, for displaying the speed of the motor.</p>
    <p>The sensor senses the speed of the motor without actually being in contact with it by the principle of light transmission and reflection and generates a signal. This signal is converted into an electric signal and fed to the microcontroller, which is programmed to calculate the speed in terms of number of motor revolutions in one minute. This speed is displayed on the 7-segment display.</p>

    <h3>Simulation of Memristor circuits for Automated Assembly System for Agriculture Application</h3>
    <p>The aim of the project is to design and simulate an automated assembling system for agriculture purpose i.e., for sowing seeds and water spraying. Agriculture automation is the main concern and emerging subject for every country.</p>
    <p>The proposed idea implements the software to perform the functions such as seed sowing, water spraying. These functions can be done using a passive circuit element called</p>
